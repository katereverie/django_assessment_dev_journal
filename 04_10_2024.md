# Day 4

## I did
1. Read about automated tests in Django and tested a bug in shell mode
2. Wrote my first test in Django.
   - know that the testing system will find tests in any file that starts with "test"
   - wrote a QuestionModelTests in `tests.py` and ran it in terminal
   - read the test result
3. Fixed the bug in the method and ran the test again. Test passed.
4. Added more tests to ensure no new bugs had been introduced by fixing the first bug
5. Ran all tests. All passed.
6. Read about writing tests for views (UI), `Django test client`
   - Django provides a test `Client` to simulate a user interacting with the code at the view level. It can be used in tests.py or in shell
   - Testing in interactive mode:  `>>>from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment`, then run `set_test_environment()`
   - __Note__: setting up a test environment enables running tests against the existing database, unlike in the first few tests in which a test database was created for testing purposes.
   - imported `Client` from `django.test`, created an instance of `Client()`
   - tried the following commands

7. Ran up server to check.
8. Modified IndexView model to exclude future polls to be shown
9. Added two more questions via admin UI, tested if a future question/a recent question will show up on the browser. 
10. Added tests for QuestionIndexView, and a helper function to create Question object for testing
