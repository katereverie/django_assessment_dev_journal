# Day 4

## I did
1. Read about automated tests in Django and tested a bug in shell mode
2. Wrote my first test in Django.
   - know that the testing system will find tests in any file that starts with "test"
   - wrote a QuestionModelTests in `tests.py` and ran it in terminal
   - read the test result
3. Fixed the bug in the method and ran the test again. Test passed.
4. Added more tests to ensure no new bugs had been introduced by fixing the first bug
5. Ran all tests. All passed.
6. Read about writing tests for views (UI), `Django test client`
   - Django provides a test `Client` to simulate a user interacting with the code at the view level. It can be used in tests.py or in shell
   - Testing in interactive mode:  `>>>from django.test.utils import setup_test_environment`, then run `set_test_environment()`
