Part 8 - 3rd Party Packages

## Installing Django Debug Toolbar

Things to remember:
1. The Django debug toolbar is a 3rd party package.

Installation:
1. run command `python -m pip install django-debug-toolbar`

Post-Installation setup
1. add the package's Django app to `INSTALLED_APPS` setting. Some packages need other changes, such as addtions to URLconf (`urls.py`)
2. ensure `TEMPLATES` variable contains `DjangoTemplates` backend whose `APP_DIRS` options is set to `True`
3. add `debug_toolbar` to `INSTALLED_APPS`
4. in `urls.py` import `debug_toolbar_urls` from `debug_toolbar.toolbar`, concatenate `debug_toolbar_urls()` to `urlpatterns`
5. add in `settings.py`
   ```
   MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    "debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware",
    # ...]
   ```
   remember: place debug toolbar after any middleware that modifies the response's content (any compression-related middleware), but before any that might affect the content rendering or caching
6. Configure Internal IPs (if not existent in settings, add one)
   ```
   INTERNAL_IPS = [
    # ...
    "127.0.0.1",
    # ...]
    ```
7. (optional) disbale toolbar when running tests by adding an if statement in urls.py to urlpatterns
   - __Note__: be aware of duplicates in INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE since you are using an if-statement to add debu toolbar to both variables.
