# Day 2

## Things I did
1. Started a Django tutorial project (mysite/polls), following offical documentation
2. Tried to set up an virtual development environment following the "Setup" instruction in the README file.
3. Took a look at the loaded data
4. Managed to start a development server and look at admin view, and user view. 

## Problems I encountered
1. Due to unfamiliarity with the framework, I could only guess the function of each file by glancing through their content, by comparision with what I am more familiar with: ASPE.NET Core, which is a Web Development Fraemwork from .NET Core.
2. Using correct commands in PowerShell since the setup instruction seems to use commands for Unix OS. 

## Things my intuition was correct about
1. Even though I haven't got to learn ASP.NET Core MVC yet, I suspected that "view" in Django is similar to MVC.
2. On modeling, while C# uses ORM such as Entity Framework and Dapper, Django uses "models" from "django.db". What stood out to me is the lack of a dbContext that is present in Entity Framework
3. Interestingly, Django doesn't use SQL syntax. In this sense, Django seems similar to Entity Framework, despite that with Entity Framework you can also use SQL syntax. 

## Plans for the next day
1. Go through a Django Tutorial to familiarize myself with the basic components of a Django web project.
