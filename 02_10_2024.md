# Day 2

## Things I did & Learned
1. Started a Django tutorial project (mysite/polls), following offical documentation
2. installed Django globally
3. updated it to the lastest version
4. figured out which set of terminal commands to use
5. Got to know what "manage.py" does
6. Gained a basic idea of the typical folder structure of a Django project
7. Successfully ran local dev server
8. Successfully created the Polls app
9. Gained a basic idea of what "views.py" does
10. Gained a basic idea of what "urls.py" does
11. Set up a SQLite database, by installing SQLite
12. Created a table in the database using "migrate" command
13. Gained an idea of what INSTALLED_APPS does in `settings.py`
14. Figured out how to access SQLite database through CLI.
15. Created two models: "Question" and "Choice"; both are related to each other in an one-to-many relationship
16. Got an idea of how model representation is done in Django: basically, each model is represented by a class that inherits from `django.db.models.Model`
17. Got to compare the difference between model representation in Django and in C#. In C#, it's done via properties while in Python, it's through class variables (fields). But fundamentally, there's not a big difference. The difference in specification of field types was also interesting for me to see. Since C# is statically typed, declaring a property would also require a type declaration, while in Python it's done through methods of `models`, such as `models.CharField()` and `models.DateTimeField()`
18. Difference in naming fields: Python uses snake-case - no surprise there - while C# uses proper case.
19. Successfully activated models - a. include `polls.apps.PollsConfig` in `INSTALLED_APPS` in the `settings.py` file; b. type in `python manage.py makemigrations polls` in the terminal and enter
20. Gained an idea of what __migration__ means in Django. Basically, migration means changes made to the database. Migrations are how Django stores changes to models, and ergo the database schema. The things Django would do to avoid SQL syntax amaze me.
