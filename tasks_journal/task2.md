# Overview 

The index page should render a list of all appointments, with required information (see table in index.html). Adjust the view ("core.views.index") and template ("core/index.html") accordingly.

## 

Notes:
1. The index page is at the root. Since no domain name, the base address is: "http://127.0.0.1:8000/"
