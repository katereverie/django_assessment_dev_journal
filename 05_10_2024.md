# Day 5

## Overview

The basic structure and functionalities of the poll app have been built. It's time to "flesh it out" with styles.

## I did / learned
1. Bigger projects must manage static files. `django.contrib.staticfiles` collects static files from each of your applications (and any other places you want) into a __single__ location that can be served in production
2. First things first: Customize the app's look
   - created a subfolder "static" in the "polls" folder via terminal. *name the folder "static" helps Django locate the hub of static files.
   - created a subfolder "polls" within "static", and a "style.css" file in this "polls"
     - Django's `STATICFILES_FINDERS` setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources (various apps in one project)
     - One of the default finders is "AppDirectoriesFinder". It looks for a "static" subdir in each of the "INSTALLED_APPS".
     - Thanks to "AppDirectoriesFinder", you can reference the "style.css" file using the path "polls/style.css"
     - To help finders locate static files, use static file __namespacing__, in case you have two different static files with the same name.
     - Basically, static file __namespacing__ is just putting static files inside another directory named for the application itself
  - selected `li` element and made its color property green
  - added `{% load static %}` and a link element with href pointing to the css file
  - ran server to test if color had been applied.
      - Bug: style not applied.
      - Debug:
        - checked terminal message, could not find the style file: `[05/Oct/2024 10:04:18] "GET /static/polls/style.css HTTP/1.1" 404 1859`
        - copied the path of `style.css` with a right click and select
        - pasted the path in the terminal and found out that the css file was located outside of the folder 'polls'
        - dragged the css file into `polls`
        - reran the server, bug fixed.
   - added more style in css.file
3. Customize the admin form
   - created a class to tell Django the options when registering an object
   - passed the class holding the object(s) as an argument in `admin.site.register()`.
   - Basically, the pattern is: create a model admin class, pass it as the 2nd argument to `admin.site.register()`, any time you need to change the admin options for a model
   - split the form up into fieldsets (instead of one field with two objects).
   - bug: custom layout not implemented
   - debug: "fieldsets" spelled wrong
   - so, if you spelled fieldsets wrong, Django won't recognize it
   - tried integrating `Choice` into `Question` by creating a `ChoiceInline` class
   - tried two layout options `admin.StackedInline` and `admin.TabularInline`, passing both as parameters in `ChoiceInline` class
   - customized the admin change list which displays all the questions
   - By default, Django displays the `str()` of each object.
   - We want to customize it by having it display individual fields by using `list_display` admin option
     Before adding `list_display = ["question_text", "pub_date"]` to `QuestionAdmin` class

     Adding another field:
     ![asdasd](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ceada4b-4661-434d-89a0-66eb9d460155)
   - You can click on the column headers to sort by those values except for `was_published_recently` header, because sorting by the output of an arbitary method is not supported
   - customized column headers by adding `@admin.display` to `Question` model class
   - added `list_filter` for `pub_date` in `QuestionAdmin`
   ![123123123](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5417faa5-5082-47b2-8d93-e4ccf9c4957b)
   - added `search_fields` for `question_text` in `QuestionAdmin`

   - __Note__:
     - Django uses a __LIKE__ query under the hood, so it's best to limit the number of search fileds to a reasonable number for better database search
     - change lists offer free pagination. The default is to display 100 items per page.
4. Customize project's templates, e.g. header of the admin page (default: Django administration)
   - created a `templates` dir in the project dir (the one that contains `manage.py`)
     - In principle, templates can be put anywhere in the file system that Django can access because Django runs as whatever user your server runs. BUT, keeping your templates within the project is a good convention to follow.
   - added `BASE_DIR / "templates"` to `'DIRS': []` in `TEMPLATES` list in `settings.py`
     - `DIRS` is a list of filesystem directories to check when loading Django templates; it's a search path
     - __Note__: Just like the static files, we could have all our templates together, in one big templates directory, and it would work perfectly well. However, templates that belong to a particular application should be placed in that application’s template directory (e.g. polls/templates) rather than the project’s (templates).
   - created a dir "admin" inside "templates"
   - copied the template `admin/base_site.html` from the default Django admin template directory in the source code of Django itself, which is located at `django/contrib/admin/templates`
     - Alternatively, you can also type `python -c "import django; print(django.__path__)"` in the terminal and press enter
     - found 'admin/base_site.html', copied and pasted it into the folder 'admin'
     - replaced the "Django Administration" with "Polls Administration"
     - __Note__:
       - This is one way to override templates: copy it from the default dir into your custom dir, and make changes as fit
       - In an actual project, you'd probably use `django.contrib.admin.AdminSite.site_header` attribute to make this particular customization
       - Template files contain texts like `{% block branding %}` and `{{ title }}`. These tags are part of Django's template language. When Django renders, say, `admin/base_site.html`, this template language will be evaluated to produce the final HTML page
