# Day 5

## Overview

The basic structure and functionalities of the poll app have been built. It's time to "flesh it out" with styles.

## I did / learned
1. Bigger projects must manage static files. `django.contrib.staticfiles` collects static files from each of your applications (and any other places you want) into a __single__ location that can be served in production
2. First things first: Customize the app's look
   - created a subfolder "static" in the "polls" folder via terminal. *name the folder "static" helps Django locate the hub of static files.
   - created a subfolder "polls" within "static", and a "style.css" file in this "polls"
     - Django's `STATICFILES_FINDERS` setting contains a list of finders that know how to discover static files from various sources (various apps in one project)
     - One of the default finders is "AppDirectoriesFinder". It looks for a "static" subdir in each of the "INSTALLED_APPS".
     - Thanks to "AppDirectoriesFinder", you can reference the "style.css" file using the path "polls/style.css"
     - To help finders locate static files, use static file __namespacing__, in case you have two different static files with the same name.
     - Basically, static file __namespacing__ is just putting static files inside another directory named for the application itself
  - selected `li` element and made its color property green
  - added `{% load static %}` and a link element with href pointing to the css file
  - ran server to test if color had been applied.
      - Bug: style not applied.
      - Debug:
        - checked terminal message, could not find the style file: `[05/Oct/2024 10:04:18] "GET /static/polls/style.css HTTP/1.1" 404 1859`
        - copied the path of `style.css` with a right click and select
        - pasted the path in the terminal and found out that the css file was located outside of the folder 'polls'
        - dragged the css file into `polls`
        - reran the server, bug fixed.
